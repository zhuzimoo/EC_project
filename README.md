## Abstract
Abstract
The remarkably complex mechanisms underpin the intricate functions of endothelial cells (EC) across different tissues and vessel types. However, a systematic investigation of EC heterogeneity in the combined context of vessel types and tissue microenvironmental regulation is still largely lacking. In this study, we integrated single-cell RNA-sequencing data from 15 human tissues. We found that ECs were highly tissue-specific in some tissues (e.g. heart and kidney), with tissue specificity greater than the vessel specificity, whereas ECs in other tissues are more vessel-specific. Moreover, we developed a computational pipeline to investigate the microenvironmental regulation of EC regarding cell-cell communications (CCC) mediated by metabolites or proteins. Interestingly, the result showed that the detected CCC events for EC varied vastly across tissues, implying the tissue-specific EC interactions with the microenvironments. Using a topic modeling algorithm, we identified CCC patterns between EC and other tissue-resident cells, named CCC topics, for metabolite-mediated and protein-mediated CCC events. Among the identified CCC topics, most demonstrated high tissue specificity to potentially explain the microenvironmental signals to regulate EC heterogeneity across human tissues. The work presented a systematic investigation of EC heterogeneity and provided insights into how EC heterogeneity was regulated within diverse tissue microenvironments.
